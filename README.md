# 🧠 ADHD Cognitive Overload Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning application that predicts **cognitive overload intensity** for individuals with ADHD using daily behavioral signals such as sleep, screen time, stress, task load, and focus.

The project demonstrates a full ML pipeline — from data generation and probabilistic labeling to regression modeling, explainability, and deployment via a Streamlit web app.
